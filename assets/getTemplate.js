const template = `Hi [Recruiterâ€™s Name],

Iâ€™m reaching out to express interest in exploring engineering opportunities at [Company Name]. With over 7+ years of experience in product-driven environments, Iâ€™ve led and shipped scalable platforms using React, Node.js, and AWS, with a sharp focus on performance, security, and long-term maintainability.

Most recently at DAZN, I architected a real-time partner integration platform using React + Next.js and NestJS, reducing onboarding time by 60% and improving cross-system consistency to 99.9%. Iâ€™ve also worked extensively on OAuth/OIDC flows, infrastructure cost optimization (25%+), and end-to-end API integrations for high-growth B2B ecosystems.

Iâ€™m particularly drawn to [Company Name]â€™s product depth and engineering culture. If there are frontend or full-stack roles that match my background, Iâ€™d be excited to explore further.

PFB following links that summarize my career. If you can't access the same, I have attached my resume for your reference.
